                <h3>Steps</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
                    <li>Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken 
                        in the hot oil in batches until completely browned. Transfer the browned 
                        chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium-high; add the onion, garlic, 
                        and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet and cook and stir until the 
                        onion turns translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir the curry powder, cumin, 
                        turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion 
                        mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring. 
                        Mix the tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon 
                        salt into the mixture. Return the chicken breast to the skillet along 
                        with any juices on the plate. Pour 1/2 cup water into the mixture; bring 
                        to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle the
                        garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li>
                    <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until the chicken breasts are no longer pink
                        in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read 
                        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 
                        165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
