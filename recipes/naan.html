        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This recipe makes the best naan I have tasted outside of an Indian restaurant. 
            I can't make enough of it for my family. I serve it with shish kabobs, 
            but I think they would eat it plain.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 cup warm water</li>
                <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
                <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
                <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. 
                    Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy. Stir in sugar, milk, egg, salt, 
                    and enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead for 6 to 8 minutes on a lightly 
                    floured surface, or until smooth. Place dough in a well oiled bowl, 
                    cover with a damp cloth, and set aside to rise. Let it rise 1 hour, 
                    until the dough has doubled in volume.</li>
                <li>Punch down dough, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough 
                    about the size of a golf ball. Roll into balls, and place on a tray. 
                    Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 
                    30 minutes.</li>
                <li>During the second rising, preheat grill to high heat.</li>
                <li>At grill side, roll one ball of dough out into a thin circle. 
                    Lightly oil grill. Place dough on grill, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, 
                    or until puffy and lightly browned. Brush uncooked side with butter, 
                    and turn over. Brush cooked side with butter, and cook until browned, 
                    another 2 to 4 minutes. Remove from grill, and continue the process until 
                    all the naan has been prepared.</li>
            </ol>
